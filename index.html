            Fetch yourself a fat-bottom skillet

            Place one slice of the buttered bread, <em>buttered side down</em>, into the skillet
        </li>

            Quickly place each slice of cheese on the bread, being sure to cover the entire surface area

        <strong>Note:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press.<br>
     The result will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.

     <strong>Remember</strong>, Shaun says <em>"Grilled cheese sandwiches are a staple of the North American diet!"</em>.
